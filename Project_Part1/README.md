# feup-prog-agency-project
 
**Programming Project (1st Year, 2nd Semester, FEUP) - Part 1**

All the objectives of the project were done, except the treatment of invalid user inputs, only implemented in some situations.
For example, the program can't handle with the fact of the user input be a invalid date or writing the NIF when it's asked by the Name.
Invalid date means that user inserted an invalid date and the program still goes on without verifying it. For example: 2019/15/36.

All the fuctionalities of the project were implemented, using apropriate date structures e the struct of the program is made by multiple functions.

No header file was used.
